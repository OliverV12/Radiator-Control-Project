# Radiator-Control-Project
Design a control system for turning on and off a radiator (both heuristic and optimal) that simultaneously considers the outdoor atmospheric temperature, the indoor room temperature, and the rate of change of the indoor temperature based on the outdoor temperature (stochastic with time-varying mean).
